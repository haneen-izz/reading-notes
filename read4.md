### Creating HTML is cumbersome

Even in such a simple HTML we wanted to create we had to use + several time and the code is quite unreadable. Imagine what would happen if we wanted to build a more complex application where we might want to build a list of items, or even a table. Building the HTML on the fly and the inserting in the DOM would be quite nasty.

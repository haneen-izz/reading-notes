# REST
In the REST architectural style, the implementation of the client and the implementation of the server can be done independently without each knowing about the other. This means that the code on the client side can be changed at any time without affecting the operation of the server

**questions**

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

`He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internetâ€¦ and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.`

2. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
`The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.`
3.  What does a GET do?
 `It is. Especially when you're using a web browser because browsers pretty much just GET stuff. They don't do a lot of other types of interaction with resources. This is a problem because it has led many people to assume that HTTP is just for GET'ing. But HTTP is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.`
4. What does a POST do?
`The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.`

5. What does PUT do?
`PUT method is used to update resource available on the server. Typically, it replaces whatever exists at the target URL with something else. You can use it to make a new resource or overwrite an existing one`
6. What does PATCH do?
`A patch is a set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, with such patches usually being called bugfixes or bug fixes.`

**http** 

 That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing. it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

So you’ve heard of Node.js, but aren’t quite sure what it is or where it fits into your development workflow. Or maybe you’ve heard people singing Node’s praises and now you’re wondering if it’s something you need to learn. Perhaps you’re familiar with another back-end technology and want to find out what’s different about Node.

**questions**

1. What is node.js?
`Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.`
2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
`The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.`
3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
`Node. js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests.`

4. What is npm?

`npm is the world's largest Software Library (Registry) npm is also a software Package Manager and Installer`

## `Hello, World` the Node.js Way

You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing node `-v`. If all has gone well, you should see something like v12.14.1 displayed. This is the current LTS version at the time of writing.

Next, create a new file hello.js and copy in the following code:
`console.log("Hello, World!");`

## node used for

Now that we know what Node and npm are and how to install them, we can turn our attention to the first of their common uses: installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

*the command to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?*

You can install jshint locally with npm install jshint or globally with npm install -g jshint . If your jshint module is in a different location, use the jshint. nodePath setting to specify the correct path


## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce. What if you can could get all of this, instantaneously, while typing code line by line and character by character? You can, with pair programming, a technique common to many agile work environments.


* What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

* In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
 **Engaged collaboration**

* How does pair programming work?
Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

During a five-hour paired lab session, Code Fellows students work on all four of these language-specific skills. The abilities they foster will serve them well in completing assignments, in their own communication and learning, in interviews, and in readiness for a job at a company that utilizes this agile practice.

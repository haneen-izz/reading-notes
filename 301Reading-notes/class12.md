SQL | NoSQL
 ------------ | ------------- 
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS);  | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
SQL databases have predefined schema| NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
SQL databases are vertically scalable |  NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
or the type of data to be stored: SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage | NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data

* What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

`If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.`

# introduction 
what is HTML and css?
it is used to create web pages. You will see that you start by writing down 
the words you want to appear 
on your page. You then add tags 
or elements to the words so 
that the browser knows what is 
a heading, where a paragraph 
begins and ends.

#### css




* in any story there will be a headline and some text also image, in addition  If the  article is a long 
piece, there may be subheadings 
that split the story into separate 
sections or quotes from those 
involved. 

* The structure is very similar 
when a news story is viewed 
online.

* an 
insurance form. Insurance forms 
often have headings for different 
sections, and each section 
contains a list of questions with 
areas for you to fill in details or 
checkboxes to tick.

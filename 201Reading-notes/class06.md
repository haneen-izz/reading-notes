# introduction

## what is the hardest thing about coding?
first of all:
- Naming things
- Testing your code
- Debugging
- Learning a new technology

## I’ve found the single hardest thing about programming is learning the problem domain.
- A familiar problem
When I first started using the Protein Tracker example in my Android course, I was just looking for a simple example of an application that could be easily understood and implemented.
here like this :

simply that by taking away the problem domain, or making it so trivial that it is easily understood, I am able to make both teaching and learning easier.

* Why problem domains are hard?
The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all.

### if you understand the problem domain well sp the programming will be easy:
Most of the work at the time was basic waterfall development, here was however something really interesting about the waterfall approach and the extreme amount of specification that was done before anything was built—it was very easy to write the code for a feature.

**You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.**

## WHAT IS  AN OBJECT?
0bjects group together a set of variables and  functions to create a model 
of a something you would recognize from the real  world. In  an  object, 
variables and  functions take on  new names. 

```
var  hote l  =  { 
name: 'Quay', 
rooms :  40, booked :  25, 
checkAvailability: function() { 
return  this.rooms-this.booked; 
}};
var  el Name = document.getElementByld('hotelName');
elName.textContent = hotel.name;
```

### The Document Object Model (DOM): 
specifies how browsers should create a model of an  HTML page and how JavaScript can  access and  update the contents of a web page while it is  in the browser window. 
- THE DOCUMENT NODE Above, you can see the HTML code for a shopping list, and on the right hand page is its DOM tree.

Accessing and  updating the DOM tree involves two steps: 
1. Locate the node that represents the element you  want to work with. 
2.  Use its text content, child elements, and attributes. 

## Here are  three common ways to select an individual element: 
`getElementByld()`
`querySe1ector()`

### selecting elements using attributes:
```
\\ Select  the  element and  store  it in  a  variable. 
var  el = document.getElementByid('one'); 
\\ Change  the  value  of  the  class  attribute. 
el.className  ='cool ' ; 
```

### selecting elements using class attributes: 

```
var  elements  = document . getE l ementsByClassName('hot'); 
if  (elements.length>  2) { 
    var el = elements[2];
    el.className = 'class';

```
### traversing the DOM:
When you  have an element node, you  can  select another element in relation to it using these five properties. This is  known as  travers ing the  DOM.
 + parentNode
 + previousSibling
 + firstChild and lastChild  



 ## previous and next sibling

```
var  startltem  = document.getElementByid('two'); 
var  prevltem startltem.previousSibling; 
var  next l tem = startitem.nextSibling; 
prevltem.className 'complete ' ; 
nextltem.className 'cool'; 
```

### containing elements
|PROPERTY | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | ----------- |
|innerHTML| you can access and amend the contents of an  element, including any child elements |
|textContent | allows you  to collect or update just the text that is  in the containing element |

### XSS: escaping and controlling markup
Any content generated by users that contain characters that are used in code should be escaped on  the server.  You  must control any markup added to the page. 

### summary: 
* An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are  siblings of each  other.
* In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery). 
* Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM  tree

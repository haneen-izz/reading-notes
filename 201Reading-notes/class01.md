# introduction 
## how the web works?
When you visit a website, the web server 
hosting that site could be anywhere in the 
world. In order for you to find the location of 
the web server, your browser will first connect 
to a Domain Name System (DNS) serve.

## how people access the web?
1. Browsers
2. web servers
3. screen readers


## what is HTML and css?
it is used to create web pages. You will see that you start by writing down 
the words you want to appear 
on your page. You then add tags 
or elements to the words so 
that the browser knows what is 
a heading, where a paragraph 
begins and ends.

## css
uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages. We then go on to look at the wide variety of CSS properties you can use in your CSS rules.

## structure

* in any story there will be a headline and some text also image, in addition  If the  article is a long piece there may be subheadings that split the story into separate sections or quotes from those involved. 

* The structure is very similar when a news story is viewed online.

* an insurance form. Insurance forms often have headings for different sections, and each section contains a list of questions with areas for you to fill in details or checkboxes to tick.

### so here the summarizing of the structure: 
+ Tags are often referred to as elements. 
+ Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
+ Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
+ Attributes require a name and a value.


## extra markup 

### doctype 
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included). We will therefore be including one in each example for the rest of the book:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
### comments in html 
f you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:

```
<!-- comment goes here -->
```


### inline elements
Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.

```
Timed to a single revolution of the planet around 
the sun at a 23.4 degrees tilt that plays out the 
rhythm of the seasons, this <em>Origins of Art</em> 
cycle is organized around four themes: <b>science, 
architecture, history</b> and <b>religion</b>.
```

### HTML5 Layout
#### The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of  
different parts of a web page and help to describe      
its structure.

### summary of HTML 5 layout: 
|number of sentence| Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1 | The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).|
| 2 | Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements. |
| 3 |To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,which is available free from Google|

## Process & Design
### wireframe
wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

### summary of Process & Design: 
+ Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
+ You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style. 
+ You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

## javaScript
it is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

### the ABC of programming 

### A
What is a script and how do I create one?

- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically. 
- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

# mastring markdown
is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic,
adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 

### You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:
   + Gists
   + Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
   + Files with the .md or .markdown extension
